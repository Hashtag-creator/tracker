# Health Tracker Application

## Overview

This project is a health tracker designed to help users monitor their health, including tracking calorie intake and exercise. The tracker provides personalized recommendations based on user input such as age, weight, and activity levels. Additionally, the app uses machine learning models (via `scikit-learn`) to offer data-driven insights and progress tracking. The application is built with Streamlit for a seamless user interface and uses Matplotlib for visualizing health data trends.

## Features

- **User Profile**: Collect user data such as age, weight, height, and activity level.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on entered data, the app provides tailored calorie intake and exercise recommendations.
- **Machine Learning Insights**: Uses `scikit-learn` to analyze the data and provide data-driven predictions and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize trends and progress using `Matplotlib` charts.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly, interactive interface powered by Streamlit.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python with Flask (optional for storage, if needed)
- **Data Analysis**: scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Database**: SQLite or another database (optional for data storage)
